What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  An empty .git file is created inside whatever folder you are currently in.
  This is necessary in order to keep track of commits and branches

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is what's about to be committed, whereas the working
  directory is all of the files that I am working on, and the repository is
  snapshots of all of the files that have been committed

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  The staging area makes it very clear which files are about to be committed,
  and using diff I am also able to see specifically what the commit will be.
