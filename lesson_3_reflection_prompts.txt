When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows for backed-up data in the event that data is
    deleted locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    By pulling manually, you can control which commits you pull rather than
    Git deciding that for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks should be used to duplicate a repository on GitHub.
    Clones should be used to duplicate a file from GitHub onto your local
    device.
    Branches should be used when created experimental features and other things
    that should not yet be present on the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This allows you to see all of the changes made since the last known state
    of the remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub, collaboration would be done by emailing files back
    and forth between collaborators. It would be easier because you wouldn't
    have to worry about typing out git commands, but it would be harder because
    of how easily Git and GitHub allow you to view changes and share files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Changes should be made in a separate branch when the things changed, added,
    or removed from the code are experimental, represent a different version
    of the code, or for anything else that shouldn't be a part of the main,
    final version.
