When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows for backed-up data in the event that data is
    deleted locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    By pulling manually, you can control which commits you pull rather than
    Git deciding that for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks should be used to duplicate a repository on GitHub.
    Clones should be used to duplicate a file from GitHub onto your local
    device.
    Branches should be used when created experimental features and other things
    that should not yet be present on the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
